## Overview

Welcome to the **Memory MCP Server**! This project implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide long-term memory for Large Language Models (LLMs). With the growing need for more context-aware AI applications, this server acts as a bridge, allowing LLMs to retain information over extended interactions.

## Features

- **Long-term Memory**: Store and retrieve context for LLMs, enhancing their ability to provide relevant responses.
- **Model Context Protocol**: Adhere to the MCP standards for seamless integration with various LLM architectures.
- **User-Friendly API**: Easy-to-use API for developers to integrate memory functionalities into their applications.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple requests and scale with your needs.

## Installation

To get started with the Memory MCP Server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sinhan88/memory-mcp-server.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd memory-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:

   Execute the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using the API endpoints. Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to use the Memory MCP Server.

### API Endpoints

- **Store Memory**: Send a POST request to `/store` with the following JSON body:

  ```json
  {
      "context": "Your context here",
      "model_id": "unique_model_identifier"
  }
  ```

- **Retrieve Memory**: Send a GET request to `/retrieve?model_id=unique_model_identifier`.

### Example Requests

Using `curl`, you can test the API as follows:

1. **Store Memory**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/store -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"context": "I love programming.", "model_id": "model_1"}'
   ```

2. **Retrieve Memory**:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/retrieve?model_id=model_1
   ```
